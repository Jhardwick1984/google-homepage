# google-homepage
TOP assignment
My next assignment from The Odin Project asks me to replicate the Google Homepage. 
I'll be attempting to do so as accuratly as possible using my knowledge and skills in HTML and CSS (and my limited knowledge in JavaScript) that I've learned so far between T.O.P, and freeCodeCamp.  Hopefully all goes well.
